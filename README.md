## Summary: 

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** is an important, user-centric metric for measuring perceived load speed because it marks the point in the page load timeline when the page's main content has likely loaded—a fast LCP helps reassure the user that the page is useful.

- **First Input Delay (FID)** is an important, user-centric metric for measuring load responsiveness because it quantifies the experience users feel when trying to interact with unresponsive pages—a low FID helps ensure that the page is usable.

- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** is an important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts—a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful.

- The biggest factor is `search engine rankings`. Website with poor performance are being ranked lower which results is less traffic and lower conversion rates.

- But focusing on performance is very important. Google cares about this a lot, for the same reason, you should care about this a lot and that's the second reason we care about performance. It's because angry and frustrated users, because you're taking too long to show them their stuff, won't stick around long.

- If your site's a low value thing, like a content site, they might leave they might go or gonna do something else. If it's a high value, like a service and application they're in, they're gonna slowly look for alternatives or a competitor might come along, and if they can be a little bit faster, **you'll lose them**.

- **The psychology of waiting**. Each of us waited while we watch the site's load. And each of us had a different feeling, a different perception of how much time we spent, and whether that time was worth it. And that wait time is subjective.

- And this is called perceived performance. So there's some general rules that we can extract from this around the psychology of waiting. And the first is that people want to start their activity, they want to get going. If we give them a way to start earlier, they feel like the wait time is less.

- Delivering a fast and seamless navigation experience delights users and helps turn them into loyal and returning customers. For product managers, performance should be an important criteria that defines the quality and success of new product features.
